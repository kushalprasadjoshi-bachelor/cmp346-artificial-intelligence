% Define Objectives
\section{Objectives}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item To understand the basic working of the SWI-Prolog environment.
    \item To write and execute simple Prolog programs.
\end{enumerate}

% Define Requirements
\section{Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
    \item SWI-prolog
    \item Operating System: Windows
    \item Text Edioter / SWI-Prolog Edioter
\end{itemize}

% Theory
\section{Theory}
Prolog is logic programming language based on formal logic. Instead of executing instructions 
sequentially, Prolog programs define facts and rules, and computation is performed by 
querying these definations.

SWI-Prolog is a widely used Prolog implementation that provides an interactive environment, 
compiler, and extensive libraries.

% Procedure to Run Programs/Queries
\section{Procedure}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Install and open the SWI-Prolog environment on the computer.
    \item Create a new Prolog source file with the \texttt{.pl} extension.
    \item Write the required Prolog predicates (facts and rules) in the source file.
    \item Save the program in an appropriate working directory.
    \item Open the Prolog terminal and change the directory to the location of the program file.
    \item Load the Prolog source file into the interpreter using the \texttt{consult\!('file\_name.pl')} command.
    \item Execute the required queries or predicates to observe the output.
    \item Verify the output and repeat execution if necessary.
\end{enumerate}

% Result and Conclusion From the Lab Session
\section{Result and Conclusion}
The Prolog programs were executed successfully in the SWI-Prolog environment, and all facts, 
rules, and predicates produced the expected outputs. The results confirmed correct knowledge 
representation and logical inference through queries. This lab helped in understanding the 
basics of Prolog programming, the use of facts and rules, and effective interaction with the 
SWI-Prolog environment, highlighting the declarative approach of logic programming.
